               <h3>Problems: Confusing nav bar & Limited filtering system</h3>
               <p>Caring Carly is a busy working mom who wants to cook quick healthy meals for her husband and 2 young kids who are very picky eaters. In the following scenarios <b>Carly’s challenges are inspired from real data we gathered during our interviews, surveys and usability testings.</b></p>
              <p>Let’s imagine Carly just came home from work. She didn’t have time to go to the grocery store but wants to cook her family a healthy meal, so she has to use ingredients she already has at home. However, she runs into some problems:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><div class="content1">Confusing Nav Bar</div>First, she has a hard time differentiating between "Shop for Recipes" and "Find Recipes to Cook", and it is not immediately clear where she can find recipes to cook with the ingredients she has in her pantry.</li>
                  <li><div class="content1">Limited Filtering System</div>Additionally, she is frustrated that she cannot find specific types of recipes due to the limited filtering system.</li>

              <ul>
                  <li><div class="content1">Clear Nav Bar</div>In order to optimize the experience for Carly, we decided to consolidate all the recipes into a single page. We divided it into sections, the first being "Cook With What’s in My Pantry", clearly communicating to Carly where she can go to find recipes she has the ingredients for, which is a main feature of the platform.</li>
                  <li><div class="content1">Flexible Filtering System</div>In order to make it easier for Carly to find the specific type of recipes she is looking for, we designed a flexible filtering system where Carly can easily add and delete a variety of filters, which then show up on the recipes search page so she always can see the filters that are currently selected.</li>

                    <li><div class="content1">Handy Tabs to Minimize Scrolling</div>All the information is separated into 3 tabs, so <b>she doesn’t have to worry about doing too much scrolling when she gets her hands dirty in the kitchen.</b> Only by one click or swipe, she can find the information that she’s looking for.</li>
                    <li><div class="content1">Unambiguous Button</div>We also replace “Cook Now” with “Cook and Update Pantry”. By clicking on “Cook and Update Pantry”, all the ingredients that she used for cooking will be removed from the pantry.</li>

                  <ul>
                      <li><div class="content1">Too Much Scrolling</div>Firstly the images of the items are so large that it’s cumbersome for her to locate a specific item. <b>This insight is based on our usability testings that many people complained about too much scrolling on the pantry page.</b></li>
                      <li><div class="content1">No Expiration Date</div>Moreover Carley would easily forget about which item would expire soon because there’s no expiration date on the main pantry page. <b>This contradicts with our findings of interviews that many people expects to have more control of pantry items.</b></li>

                      <li><div class="content1">Notification to Get Instant Reminders</div>Now Carley receives a notification that reminds her the ingredients that would expire in 3 days. There’s no worry for her to forget about the expiration date anymore.</li>

                        <p> In the past, when Carly used the pantry item page, she found it difficult to interpret the graphs and find basic/high level nutrition information for that item.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><div class="content1">Useless Graphs</div>The graphs, which show her purchasing history of that item, weren’t particularly useful to her.</li>

                        <li><div class="content1">Key Info First</div>A pantry item’s quantity and expiration date are now prominently displayed, no longer competing with the confusing graphs. The nutrition information is more high level.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Carly decides she wants to cook the broccoli before it goes bad, so she clicks on the recommended recipe. </p>

                      <h3>Problems: Unintuitive delete interactions & Redundant price columns</h3>
                      <p> Carley discovers that she’s missing a few ingredients. She adds them to her cart and prepares to check out.</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li><div class="content1">Unintuitive Delete Interactions</div>In the original design, when Carly goes to her Cart, she is unable to edit the quantity of the items she wants to order. Removing an item from her Cart is also not a very clear process to her either.</li>
                          <li><div class="content1">Redundant Price Columns</div>In addition, she finds that having 2 price columns are unnecessary as she mostly cares about the total price she is going to pay.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>To make this process more efficient for Carly, <b>we drew inspiration from Amazon and other competitors</b>:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li><div class="content1">Swipe to Delete</div>We added a common iOS feature, where Carly can swipe over an item in order to quickly edit the item’s brand or quantity or remove it from her Cart.</li>
                          <li><div class="content1">Brands matter</div>We also added the ability to <b>change brands to meet Carly's family needs based on the interview findings.</b></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Once Carly is satisfied, she can purchase her items by selecting Proceed to checkout and can later pick them up at the grocery store and cook her family a delicious and nutritious meal.</p>

                      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>Refecting on the whole prcess,the most essential piece that we agreed to solve for was a mobile design, which we decided on after doing some <b>user interviews and surveys. This research validated our assumption that users would usually engage with the app in the kitchen on their phone.</b></p>
                        <p>Our research and design process was thorough and comprehensive. One stage that we found particularly useful was the <b>Ideation stage, during which we scoped the features for the new design by comparing current and envisioned features, and prioritizing that list.</b></p>
                        <p>
                            Here are some quotes that we got as feedback from our client. Overall, he was impressed by our level of detail and effort put into design and research, and he thought that we really captured the essence of what Nutritious Grocer is.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                          <p class="quote">"I feel they did a good job capturing the essence of what Nutritious Grocer is. It was a very collaborative process, and I enjoyed engaging with the team, which was a huge resource to really advance Nutritious Grocer far beyond what I could have done on my own." —Client</p>
