                <h2>Design Overview</h2>
                <p >Do you desire to eat healthy, but struggle to maintain these habits? Do you often stuggle with having limited time to grocery shop and search for recipes? Have you wasted a lot of money on food that goes bad?</p>
                <p>We’ve used all that we’ve learned from the UX research to redesign the Nutritious Grocer from the ground up. It is an app that allows people to search for healthy recipes, buy food related to those recipes online, and track what’s in their kitchen. Inside are handy navigation, carefully crafted filters, helpful directions, intuitive pantry, and new ways to find your next favorite recipe. This is a new app that transforms how you cook.</p>

                <p>Let’s imagine Carly just came home from work. She didn’t have time to go to the grocery store but wants to cook her family a healthy meal, so she has to use ingredients she already has at home. However, she runs into some problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, she has a hard time differentiating between "Shop for Recipes" and "Find Recipes to Cook", and it is not immediately clear where she can find recipes to cook with the ingredients she has in her pantry.</li>
                    <li>Additionally, she is frustrated that she cannot find specific types of recipes due to the limited filtering system.</li>
                </ul>

              <h3>Search for Recipes. Better in multiple ways.</h3>
              <p>In order to optimize the experience for Carly, we decided to consolidate all the recipes into a single page. We divided it into sections, the first being "Cook With What’s in My Pantry", clearly communicating to Carly where she can go to find recipes she has the ingredients for, which is a main feature of the platform.</p>
              <p>In order to make it easier for Carly to find the specific type of recipes she is looking for, we designed a flexible filtering system where Carly can easily add and delete a variety of filters, which then show up on the recipes search page so she always can see the filters that are currently selected.</p>

                <p>When Carly is preparing for cooking for recipe, she’s facing some problems with the current page:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is no visual hierarchy in displaying the information, so she has no idea about where to look first.</li>
                    <li>There is a “cook now” button for users to update the pantry. However, carly has no idea so what this button does so she has to go to the pantry page and do manual update. </li>

                <h3>Recipes. Get to the info with fewer taps.</h3>
                <p>While optimizing the product for mobile, we also add some new features. Based on our survey, we found that people cook for various number of people. In our new design, Carly can adjust the number of servings based on the number of people she cooks for, so she knows how much ingredients she need to cook for her family.</p>
                <p>All the information is separated into 3 tabs, so she doesn’t have to worry about doing too much scrolling when she gets her hands dirty in the kitchen. Only by one click or swipe, she can find the information that she’s looking for.</p>
                <p>We also replace “Cook Now” with “Cook and Update Pantry”. By clicking on “Cook and Update Pantry”, all the ingredients that she used for cooking will be removed from the pantry.</p>

                  <p>Later in the evening, after Carley has enjoyed the dinner with her family, she wants to prepare for tomorrow’s dinner. She wants to cook the items that would expire soon but she comes across some problems of the current website.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Firstly the images of the items are so large that it’s cumbersome for her to locate a specific item. This insight is based on our usability testings that many people complained about too much scrolling on the pantry page.</li>
                      <li>Moreover Carley would easily forget about which item would expire soon because there’s no expiration date on the main pantry page. This contradicts with our findings of interviews that many people expects to have more control of pantry items.</li>

                  <h3>Pantry. Manage at your fingertips.</h3>
                  <p>To help Carley keep track of what’s in her pantry, we drew inspiration from several pantry management apps in our competitor analysis. </p>
                  <p>Now Carley receives a notification that reminds her the ingredients that would expire in 3 days. There’s no worry for her to forget about the expiration date anymore.</p>
                  <p>After Carley opens the app, she can sort the items either by expiration date or by category. All the items are listed in an appropriate size. She could also search the item directly in the search bar. No scrolling effort anymore.</p>

                    <p> In the past, when Carly used the pantry item page, she found it difficult to interpret the graphs and find basic/high level nutrition information for that item.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The graphs, which show her purchasing history of that item, weren’t particularly useful to her.</li>
                        <li>The nutrition information was also a bit too detailed. She wanted something simpler.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Pantry Item. Steamline than ever.</h3>
                    <p>So, with the new design, Carly has a more streamlined experience. A pantry item’s quantity and expiration date are now prominently displayed, no longer competing with the confusing graphs. The nutrition information is more high level.</p>
                    <p>Several participants from our user interviews also expressed problems with falling into ruts of cooking the same thing over and over again. To help these users avoid such ruts, we added a section on this page of recommended recipes that include that pantry item ingredient.</p>
                    <p>Carly decides she wants to cook the broccoli before it goes bad, so she clicks on the recommended recipe. </p>

                      <p>To make this process more efficient for Carly, we drew inspiration from Amazon and other competitors. We added a common iOS feature, where Carly can swipe over an item in order to quickly edit the item’s brand or quantity or remove it from her Cart. We also added the ability to change brands to meet Carly's family needs.</p>
                      <p>Once Carly is satisfied, she can purchase her items by selecting Proceed to checkout and can later pick them up at the grocery store and cook her family a delicious and nutritious meal.</p>

                      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>Refecting on the whole prcess,the most essential piece that we agreed to solve for was a mobile design, which we decided on after doing some user interviews and surveys. This research validated our assumption that users would usually engage with the app in the kitchen on their phone.</p>
                        <p>Our research and design process was thorough and comprehensive. One stage that we found particularly useful was the Ideation stage, during which we scoped the features for the new design by comparing current and envisioned features, and prioritizing that list.</p>
                        <p>
                            Here are some quotes that we got as feedback from our client. Overall, he was impressed by our level of detail and effort put into design and research, and he thought that we really captured the essence of what Nutritious Grocer is.

It was a very collaborative process, and I enjoyed engaging with the team, which was a huge resource to really advance Nutritious Grocer far beyond what I could have done on my own." —Client</p>
