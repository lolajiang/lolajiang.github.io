                <p >Major depression is one of the most common mental illnesses, affecting 6.7% (more than 16 million) of American adults each year (Rockville, 2014). Depression causes people to lose pleasure from daily life, can complicate other medical conditions, and can even be serious enough to lead to suicide. Mindfulness has been proved to be effective in treating depression (Stacy, 2015), but there are four main issues:
        </p>
            <ul>
              <li>It’s hard to keep on practicing every day.</li>

              <li> It’s hard to break the habits and apply mindfulness in action.</li>

                <p>I discovered a review (Mani M, 2015) that conducted a systematic review of mindfulness-based apps and pointed out several features of selected high-quality mindfulness apps, such as providing guided meditations, timers & reminders, educational videos, and app community.</p>
                <p>Then I conducted a usability testing for three high-quality apps by visiting a mindfulness-training classroom and led 5 young female through a series of design research exercises. Talking to those people who suffered from Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) gave me a better understanding of their preferences of different featuers and the main issues they were struggling with: they provide me surprising insights that they generally like more aesthetical design despite of its complex information hierarchies. Moreover, they appreciated the progressive training programs that could help them to incorporate mindfulness into their daily lives.</p>

              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>I also talked to two depressed parents in order to understand how they perceive their mental illness and the methods they've tried. Recognizing that patients felt overwhelmed by the negative thoughts and found it hard to pick the right technique for the emotion in that specific situation, I came up with a set of design guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Knowledge Base: Help patients to build their repertoire of techniques to deal with emotion fluctuations in daily life.</li>
              <li>Support Group: Share their experience of applying the techniques in their daily lives. Moderators are necessary because they can guide the group or the community to build a positive atmosphere.</li>
              <li>Individual Counsoler: Solve the problems they meet and learn the techniques better.</li>

                <p>To tackle the untapped desires, I generated a lot of ideas (30 ideas) by staying focused on a single opportunity area. To generate this large number of ideas, I tried out each of the techniques I learned in the User Experience: Research & Prototyping: listing ideas, eliminating a constraint, making an analogy, exaggerating, and getting in the garbage. The goal here is to diverge, or generate as many ideas as possible. I give myself the safe space to be creative without judgment.</p>

                <p>To prioritize the features, I conducted a card sorting exercise with 5 people to learn about what features are important to users when they try to learn about a product and potentially get it. I provided 23 cards with a feature and a brief description written on each and asked each participant to arrange them in three decks (Favourite, So-so, Dislike). To further understand their needs, I asked them to arrange the Favourite deck in the order of importance.</p>

            <p>Users disregarded Group for Friends. They thought the practicing is a more intimate journey of self-exploration. Some of them were struggling with personal affairs like anxiety or depression. So it’s important for the app to provide the password lock rather than share button. Besides, some users didn’t like Portable EEG. They were not accustomed to wearing a clumsy hat to record their brain waves. On the contrary, Vital Signs Camera which can record breath counts was more popular because it’s less intrusive and more convenient. One mistake I made was that most users didn’t understand what MBCT-based Solutions to Negative Thoughts mean based on my description.</p>

                <p>To imagine what users can do with the mindfulness app and break it down into digestible tasks to be done, I did a feature scoping. This helped me to identify features necessary to alleviate the pain points. The engagement loop is composed of four parts:</p>

                <p>I began with a lot of sketches. From early ones with only boxes and lines all the way to some detailed sketches with icons and graphics in it. I was impressed by the design of MUJI to Relax and Pause, and I tried to make a same feeling of my app. I also created a pinterest board to gather my ideas.</p>
                <p>Then I converted the sketches to digital versions and linked them in Axure to create a clickable prototype.</p>

                <p>To figure out the information architecture and the layouts of the icons before digging deep into the nitty gritty so early, I did three usability testings with my friends. Based on their suggestions, I  decided to make the hierarchy more intuitive for users and redesign the user interface to make the application more self-explainatory.</p>

                <h5>Soon after I regretted using Pixate to design transitions so early, especially I was still in a low-fidelity stage. I should figure out the information architecture and the layouts of the icons before I dig deep into the nitty gritty so early.</h5>

                <p >With scientifically proven mindfulness meditation techniques, My app will guide users through a journey to discover a new method to life. It not only has a program-based training system, but also has day-to-day short guided exercises to help users apply this emotion control technique in action. Moreover, our support groups allow us to learn more effectively and get more feedback with professional guidance. This app has the potential to help people fight anxiety and depression better.</p>
                <p>However, never assume my design is good enough. Seek out the most critical person to get their feedback on my work. During my first iteration, I wanted to create a sense of gamification in my low-fidelity prototype, but my instructor pointed out directly my information architecture was confusing and users would get lost in various icons without texts.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>With the second iteration, I chose to rely on the Material Design framework to prioritize different functions so that users can navigate effortlessly. But on the final presentation, my classmates pointed out they like the idea of using different growth period of Mandala to represent learning progress. Those complaints boiled down to one thing - lack of individuality. People tend to seek intimacy or spirituality from this app.</p>
                <p>As Julie Zhuo mentioned, a design can be easily understood and feel well-crafted. My third iteration is taking shape, focusing more on visual design to enhance the sense of intimacy.</p>
