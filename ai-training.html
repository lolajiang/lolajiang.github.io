                <h3>Newbies are lost due to fuzzy training process and poor information architecture</h3>
                <img src="images/ai/StoryBoard1.png" alt="StoryBoard for non-power user">
                <p>Let's start with a story.</p>
                <p>Imagine you are a newbie to AI training. You want to build 3 AI robots, so you order all the materials you need online. However, when you receive the backages, you come across several problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There's no handbook at all. So you have no idea what to do next.</li>
                    <li>You are bombarded with the confusing terminologies.</li>
                    <li>The materials are mixed by 4 boxes. How to pick all the materials for a specific AI robot out of those boxes?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You end up being stuck in the middle, confronted with an error, with no confidence to go through the whole daunting process.</p>
                <h3>Experts are stuggling with inefficiency of use and low visibility of system status</h3>
                <img src="images/ai/StoryBoard2.png" alt="StoryBoard for power user">
                <p>Wait. What if you are an expert?</p>
                <p>Now you should be more confident because you know what exactly the AI training process is. However, you are also struggling with building the AI robots because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have to constantly shifting between 4 boxes to search among the mixed materials. It's so cumbersome.</li>
                    <li>You have no idea whether each step works well or not.</li>
                    <li>You mess everything up because you lose the track of each individual training progress. (Remember you have to train 3 AI robots at once.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You waste tons of hours because you have to keep checking if you have choosed the right materials out of the right box for the right AI robot.</p>

                <h5 style="text-align: center">Original information architecture. <br> Imagine how cumbersome it is to shift between 4 boxes to pick all the materials for a specific AI robot.</h5>

                <img src="images/ai/StoryBoard4.png" alt="StoryBoard for Ideal Case">
                <p>Now introducing the new design.</p>
                <p>This time you receive 3 boxes, each dedicated to a specific AI robot. Accompanied with the boxes is the training handbook. You are much more confident to do the training because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You know exactly what to do with the help of handbook.</li>
                    <li>You are more confident that you are doing changes on the right AI robot. No need to shifting between 4 boxes any more.</li>
                    <li>You can have detailed control over training steps. No confusion on whether it works at all.</li>

                <h2>1-2 Design Decisions</h2>
                <p>Welcome back to the design world!</p>
                <p>The problems users face while using our website are quite similar with the lovely characters. Users can't rely on the navigation bar to walk through the training process. Just imagine how many problems the 4 boxes in the first two sad stories have caused. So,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to make sense of the complex system?</li>
                    <li> How to communicate the training process to people?</li>
                    <li>How to help people gather key info without getting lost?</li>

                <h3>Overview Page. Keep everything on track with better information architecture</h3>
                <p>Mirroring the solutions in the previous story, I also decided to offer an overview page with all the cards, each of which dedicated to a specific AI competency. This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can see all the related info at a glance without digging deep into the website. No need to shifting between other pages any more.</li>
                    <li>You can have detailed control over training steps. You are informed of the states of training and what to do next.</li>

                     <h2>2-1 Design System</h2>
                     <h3>An approachable design system that supports our brand awareness.</h3>
                     <p>As I was designing the website, Clinc just finished its messaging style guide to support a better brand awareness. The traits that characterize us are:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Innovative</li>
                         <li>Intelligent</li>
                         <li>Imaginative</li>
                         <li>Accessible</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>However, the original visual style failed to meet the standards. I wanted to mature the Clinc brand and take the visual style from something that was very bootstrap-like to incorporating more vivid elements and mirroring the visual style of our main website. At the same time, the visual style also needs to express our brand identity.</p>
                     <p>After I created a basic style guide, I began mockup up the screens in code by creating new stylesheets. Design by coding made it really easy for me to show in real-time what projects might look like to stakeholders. This approached was much faster and allowed for quick iteration.</p>

                         <p>This is an important page, but so much space has been wasted. I added a call-to-action and created 3 new columns to clearly describe what we do and how we differentiate from others. This supports our brand awareness and customer retention.</p>
                         <p>Regarding color choices, I chose blue gradients. The blue create a professional identity, yet the hues upgrade the perception of the company in a techy way. The gradients of the icons also create an imaginative and accessible aura.</p>

                         <h3>Personality Page. Visualize the list of personalities.</h3>
                         <p>The original design discourages users to train more personalities because, not only because it is plain, but also because it's hard for users to find a specific personality through the entire list.</p>
                         <p>I added some recognizable icons to evoke interest to see more. The cards now fill the appropriate width, with buttons to clarify their usage.</p>

                         <h3>Query Log Page & Response Page. Increase the legibility.</h3>
                         <p>The query log page is a daily-to-use page for people to read through the queries and figure out what's wrong so that they can improve the AI. However, it's hard for users to scan the queries on the original website because:</p>
                         <ul>
                             <li>Different kinds of info are mixed together with various width.</li>
                             <li>The filters would disappear when scrolling down the page.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>To direct their attention to the right info, I settled down to layering levels of navigation from left-to-right. It not only creates beautiful hierarchy but also logical connection between views. A persistent sidebar simplifies navigation and removes need for scrolling up to search queries.</p>
                         <p>I also decided to place queries in cards to increase legibility. Once hovered over, the background of the card will change for scannability. Some repetitive buttons such as "full info" and "show visualization" are also hidden intentionally for better visual hierarchy.</p>
                         <p>Based on the interviews, I found that users look for the catergories of queries first, so I put them in bold and place them at the beginning of each card, allowing users to quickly scan each card to discover what interests them.</p>

                         <p>Response Page shares the same design rationalization with Query Log Page to increase the legibility. I also made use of layering levels of navigation and card design with better visual hierarchy to help users scan.</p>

                        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>The biggest challenge for this project was navigating the problem space. As the sole designer, the task of “building a design system” sounded so daunting at first compared to how comprehensive and complicated the iOS design system or the Google Material Design system are. I am glad my design hit the bar.</p>
                        <p>AI training itself is also a new problem space for me. I had to keep bugging my colleagues to understand how it actually works. With this said, I got the chance to work with so many amazingly talented individuals before I left, so it was definitely worth it.
