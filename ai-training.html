                <h2>Problem Space</h2>
                <h3>Newbies are lost due to fuzzy training process and poor information architecture</h3>
                <img src="images/ai/StoryBoard1.png" alt="StoryBoard for non-power user">
                <p>Let's start with a story.</p>
                <p>Imagine you are a newbie to AI training. You want to build 3 AI robots, so you order all the materials you need online. However, when you receive the backages, you come across several problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There's no handbook at all. So you have no idea what to do next.</li>
                    <li>You are bombarded with the confusing terminologies.</li>
                    <li>The materials are mixed by 4 boxes. How to pick all the materials for a specific AI robot out of those boxes?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You end up being stuck in the middle, confronted with an error, with no confidence to go through the whole daunting process.</p>
                <h3>Experts are stuggling with inefficiency of use and low visibility of system status</h3>
                <img src="images/ai/StoryBoard2.png" alt="StoryBoard for power user">
                <p>Wait. What if you are an expert?</p>
                <p>Now you should be more confident because you know what exactly the AI training process is. However, you are also struggling with building the AI robots because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have to constantly shifting between 4 boxes to search among the mixed materials. It's so cumbersome.</li>
                    <li>You have no idea whether each step works well or not.</li>
                    <li>You mess everything up because you lose the track of each individual training progress. (Remember you have to train 3 AI robots at once.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You waste tons of hours because you have to keep checking if you have choosed the right materials out of the right box for the right AI robot.</p>
                <img src="images/ai/StoryBoard3.png" alt="Analogy for the poor information Architecture">
                <h5 style="text-align: center">Original information architecture. <br> Imagine how cumbersome it is to shift between 4 boxes to pick all the materials for a specific AI robot.</h5>
                <h3>New design imrpoves efficiency of use, informs users of system status, and walks users through the training process</h3>
                <img src="images/ai/StoryBoard4.png" alt="StoryBoard for Ideal Case">
                <p>Now introducing the new design.</p>
                <p>This time you receive 3 boxes, each dedicated to a specific AI robot. Accompanied with the boxes is the training handbook. You are much more confident to do the training because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You know exactly what to do with the help of handbook.</li>
                    <li>You are more confident that you are doing changes on the right AI robot. No need to shifting between 4 boxes any more.</li>
                    <li>You can have detailed control over training steps. No confusion on whether it works at all.</li>

                <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
                <p>Welcome back to the design world!</p>
                <p>The problems users face while using our website are quite similar with the lovely characters. Users can't rely on the navigation bar to walk through the training process. Just imagine how many problems the 4 boxes in the first two sad stories have caused. So,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How to make sense of the complex system?</li>
                    <li> How to communicate the training process to people?</li>
                    <li>How to help people gather key info without getting lost?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Overview Page empowers users to keep everything on track with better information architecture</h3>
                <p>Mirroring the solutions in the previous story, I also decided to offer an overview page with all the cards, each of which dedicated to a specific AI competency. This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can see all the related info at a glance without digging deep into the website. No need to shifting between other pages any more.</li>
                    <li>You can have detailed control over training steps. You are informed of the states of training and what to do next.</li>

                        <h2>Challenges</h2>
                        <p>The biggest challenge for this project was navigating the problem space. The task of “building a design system” sounded so daunting at first compared to how comprehensive and complicated the iOS design system or the Google Material Design system are. I am glad my design hit the bar.</p>
                        <p>AI training itself is also a new problem space for me. I had to keep bugging my colleagues to understand how it actually works. With this said, I got the chance to work with so many amazingly talented individuals before I left, so it was definitely worth it.
