                <h1>Redesigning AI training for everyone</h1>
                <p class="intro"> I was the sole web designer for a leading conversational AI training platform for bank accounts. Making AI training make sense to people, so they can train AI easily.</p>
                <p >Clinc builds the most advanced conversational AI platform for financial services, and delivering enterprise grade AI solutions to the world's leading banking and financial industry. It’s used by companies like USAA, and gives users the power to have a new and revolutionary conversational AI experience with their financial information.</p>
                <p>As the only designer working on Clinc's AI training platform, I led the project to revamp the visual style and solve the key usability issues by continuously re-imagining what it’s like for Clinc's users to train AI. I'll share my learning on how I understand user’s mental model and break down the barriers to help them train AI easily.</p>

                <h2>How to Start a Design System and Construct it?</h2>
                <p >For the design system, I wanted to mature the Clinc brand and take the visual style from something that was very bootstrap like to incorporating more vivid and mirroring the visual style of our main website.</p>
                <p>After I created a basic style guide, I began mockup up the screens in code by creating new stylesheets. Design by coding made it really easy for me to show in real-time what projects might look like to stakeholders. This approached was much faster and allowed for quick iteration.</p>

                <p>Helping people train an AI is hard. The old website has all the features splattered around without clear information architecture for power users or helpful guidance for non-power users. People usually end up being stuck in the middle, confronted with an error or a failure, with no confidence to go through the whole daunting process.</p>

                    <h3>How might we help users understand the training process?</h3>
                  <p>At the moment, people can't rely on the sidebar to navigate the training process. How to make sense of the complex system? How to communicate the training process to people? How to apply the previous learnings to improve the flow? Also, how to break down the barriers?
                  </p>
                  <p>I then started exploring what the ideal training experience could be. After a few brainstorming sessions, I came up with a few ideas that I started designing and prototyping: steppers, a training guide section, tips, navigation bar, training guide page…</p>

                  <p>I went with the second one because this structure is the most common one (e.g. Google Slides or Coursera). Also, the second option has the least visual clutter and effectively leads users to use the training guide.

                        <p>The biggest challenge for this project was navigating the problem space. The task of “building a design system” sounded so daunting at first compared to how comprehensive and complicated the iOS design system or the Google Material Design system are. I am glad my design hit the bar.</p>
                        <p>AI training itself is also a new problem space for me. I had to keep bugging my colleagues to understand how it actually works. With this said, I got the chance to work with so many amazingly talented individuals before I left, so it was definitely worth it.
