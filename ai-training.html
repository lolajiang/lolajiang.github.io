Our competitive advantage over the competitors such as  <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://dialogflow.com/">Dialogflow (API.AI)</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://chatfuel.com/">Chatfuel</a> is the ability to empower users to talk in an unconstrained way.</p>
                  <h3>AI training process</h3>
                  <p>AI training process is quite complicated. Dialogflow (API.AI) has <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4v_QnngRdg">a half-hour video</a> dedicated to walk enginners through their AI training process on 2017 Google I/O.

                  <ul>
                      <li>The training process of a <b>competency</b> is mainly comprised of training <b>several classifications and slots</b>.</li>

                          For <b>each classification or slot</b>, it is an <b>iterative</b> training process:

                <p>Through an interactive design process, I was quickly moving between paper and <b>digital prototyping, testing prototypes with users, and getting feedback</b> from my mentor and AI engineers. From each iteration, I learned something valuable. Some helped me make small usability improvements, some helped me make major changes in my design direction.</p>
                <h3>Initial iterations for a clear training process</h3>
                <p>After a few brainstorming sessions, <b>I experimented with all different ways of walking users through training process</b>: steppers, a training guide section, tips, navigation bar, training guide page…</p>

                <p>I settled down with creating a training guide page with work area because users can <b>walk through the iterative training process without burden of switching pages</b>.

                <p>I went with the second one because this structure is the most common one (e.g. Google Slides or Coursera). Also, the second option has the least visual clutter and effectively leads users to use the training guide.</p>
                <h3>Second-round iterations to improve efficiency of use</h3>
                <p>As I was making progress on clear training process, I was also thinking about what would be an easy way for people to gather key info efficiently. This is a tricky task. I spent hours trying to figure this out:</p>

                  <h3>Query Log Page & Response Page. Increase the legibility.</h3>
                  <p>The query log page is a daily-to-use page for people to read through the queries and figure out what's wrong so that they can improve the AI. However, it's hard for users to scan the queries on the original website because different kinds of info are mixed together with various width.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><div class="content1">Layering Levels of Navigation from Left-to-right</div>To direct their attention to the right info, I settled down to layering levels of navigation from left-to-right. It not only creates beautiful hierarchy but also logical connection between views.</li>
                      <li><div class="content1">Persistent Sidebar</div>A persistent sidebar simplifies navigation and removes need for scrolling up to search queries.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <img class="browser-screenshot" src="images/ai/querylog.png" alt="before vs after query log page"/>
                  <h5 style="text-align: center">Query Log Page. Increase the legibility of queries.</h5>
                  <p>Response Page shares the same design rationalization with Query Log Page to increase the legibility. I also made use of layering levels of navigation and card design with better visual hierarchy to help users scan.</p>
                  <img class="browser-screenshot" src="images/ai/response.png" alt="before vs after response page"/>

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>The biggest challenge for this project was navigating the problem space. As the sole designer, the task of “building a design system” sounded so daunting at first compared to how comprehensive and complicated the iOS design system or the Google Material Design system are. I am glad my design hit the bar.</p>
                    <p>AI training itself is also a new problem space for me. I had to keep bugging my colleagues to understand how it actually works. With this said, I got the chance to work with so many amazingly talented individuals before I left, so it was definitely worth it.
